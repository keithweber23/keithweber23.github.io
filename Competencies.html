                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Non-Profit Proposal</b><p class="indent flow-text">Making a difference in a field often requires a plan of action for any worthwhile change to come along. For this narrative, I focused on the field of addiction. With the help of a Professor, I explored various strategies a nonprofit can deploy when bringing change to this subject. This project marked the birth of what I call: The Papers Project. Over the next few months, I would create a proposal that equated to a charter for a nonprofit. Accompanying this charter was a budget sheet that outlined just how we were going to make it all happen, down to the cost of buying and installing machinery, rental, and any other overhead conceivable.</p> <p class="indent flow-text">The idea behind the proposal was simple; we would turn locally sourced hemp into rolling papers. Our product looked to work with the altruistic side of an emerging marijuana industry. By our measure, even if we started in only two or three states where marijuana was legalized, we could net hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Such a serious sums seemed viable with our most conservative calculations. Proceeds of the sales would then be distributed to communities in the form of grants. With government funding shrinking, we hope that our organization will eventually help lead the fight in combatting our country's addiction epidemic.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Young African Leadership Initiative Student Coordinator</b><p class="indent flow-text">During the summer of 2017, I worked as a Student Coordinator for the Mandela Washington Fellowship’s Young African Leader Initiative (YALI). Out of 60,000 applications, 1,000 would be accepted, of those 1,000, only 25 would make it to Kansas State University. Our Fellow’s represented the brightest emerging civic leaders in Africa, coming 23 different sub-Saharan nations; within our group, 13 were women and 12 were men and they ranged from 25-35 years old. For six weeks we spent our days and nights together exploring various strengths and values held within the group. My role as a staff member was to both coordinate the learning programs and be a cultural liaison. I showed the African Fellows our night-life and put into perspective the misconceptions of what being a Midwesterner meant to us. Our staff would regularly invite our new friends into our homes for movies, meals, and to explore hot topics such as racial discrimination, gender identity, and sexuality. By the end of this program, I had found 25 new friends, and just as many new homes if I were ever to visit Africa.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Chair of Project Europe 21</b><p class="indent flow-text">Just as our lives aren’t lived within boxes, decisions shouldn’t be made in a similar confinement. I learned this lesson while working as the Chair for ‘Project Europe 21’. This project was a capstone assignment for my Junior year studying abroad. The group was comprised of four Dutch students, plus myself. The project creators tasked our group with creating a report and then presenting our findings to a panel of business and scholarly officials. They instructed us that this report should cover how European businesses should adapt to the Internet of Things by using examples of other European based companies.</p><p class="indent flow-text">Over the stretch of our research, our team would face barriers about how to further our research without losing the tone: stay thorough but focused. These roadblocks were things like exploring legal issues, technological adaptations, and societal implementations of various projects. As the Chair, the group often looked to me for guidance at these roadblocks. Knowing the general areas I had wanted the project to cover, I frequently convened with my team before progressing. Without gaining advice from each member our team would have neglected our strengths. Overcoming our barriers, we went on to create something we all contributed to and proudly presented it to the Jury. </p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Club Book Sale</b><p class="indent flow-text">When working with school clubs, it’s not uncommon to find the coffers empty. Some clubs use dues to raise money, others go the way of fundraising. Thanks to a book donation from an alumnus that passed, Spring 2016 Anthropology club would run a massively successful book sale. The books had sat around for years, as past assemblies of the club didn’t follow through on any plans. Part of a newly elected Executive council, I would attend planning events and help table every opportunity I could.</p><p class="indent flow-text">
We planned to keep it open for two weeks, for a couple of hours a day. We chalked and placed posters around campus in the days leading up to the event. Books sold for around $2.50 each, but the nicer, hardback, books would go for $5 or more. In a week's time, we had raised hundreds of dollars. We sold ourselves right out of a spot on campus; ending the sale early because we found ourselves hitting a plateau of interest. This money would go on to sending our members to national Anthropology events, for us to engage the field and event present ourselves.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Navigating Language Barriers Abroad</b><p class="indent flow-text">In my earlier section, ‘Collaborative Decision Maker’, I had discussed working as the Chair for ‘Project Europe 21’. Leading a group of 4 other students, I was the only native English speaker of the group. Having all been raised in the Netherlands, the others were fluent in some capacity. However, many ideas were lost in translation. Moreover, I originally had difficulty articulating my thoughts. These difficulties came from me naturally speaking quickly, and forgetting to slow down. In our first couple weeks, we would find ourselves often times repeating ourselves and rehashing conversations. As I learned to slow my speech, I became equally good at asking others to elaborate on thoughts. In meetings, I would take notes of what others were working on and constantly double-checked progression as best I could. In the end, our team overcame language barriers to create a great project to submit to the Jury that would be reviewing our work.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Community Outreach Project</b><p class="indent flow-text">Interested in creating a lasting impact on the community, our LEAD 405 class collaborated to aid a local transportation nonprofit. Along the way, we learned how to explore the needs of communities and grow on pre-existing infrastructures. Called Green Apple Bikes (GAB), the organization we worked alongside provides fleets of free bikes to the Manhattan area for all to use. They’d maintain and distribute the bikes themselves and ran on donations and volunteers alone. Through a semester of deliberate engagements, our class uncovered concerns with spreading their message and engaging more volunteers. Three subcommittees were generated to further refine rough ideas of what could help GAB.</p><p class="indent flow-text">When the semester came to an end, we had three separate and at times incoherent directives to help out the organization. This is where the project would have died. However, I was eager to help the idea progress. Empowered by my professors, I spent the summer melding the outlines into a single proposal. The final-project looked to provide a thorough guide for executing our ideas. Complete with contact information for community allies and social media tools, I presented the final project to my professor to pass on. With this project, I hoped to capitalize on our semester's work and provide a usable artifact to GAB. To me, mobility is crucial for a community’s ability to bond and grow. These bikes transport people to stores, work, and school and I wanted to play a part by ensuring this program continued to grow its outreach.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Getting Others Involed</b><p class="indent flow-text">The 2016 election cycle was an impassioned affair for many. To me, it became a fight for a voice. Never having a title for my political beliefs, I’ve always felt alienated from the parties in America. I engaged in the process early this cycle; I can recall watching Bernie Sanders making his announcement to run in early 2015. It was all uphill from there. I would make a point to watch him in debates and followed the movement when I could. Midway through the primaries, I would leave the country, however, that wasn’t the end of my engagement. I began by joining the thousands of others donating to his campaign. Even though I now lived thousands of miles away from Kansas, I reached out to friends to encourage them to vote. I phone and Facebook banked when I could, often resorting to the latter because of time differences.</p><p class="indent flow-text">Early on people labeled these efforts as futile. However, I found the opposite to be true. My fellow volunteers reminded me I’m not alone in my beliefs. Although Bernie's campaign was over, I continued encouraging those to engage in their communities when I returned to America. In this role, I convinced fellow students to take up roles in campus leadership positions. I lead others to serve alongside me on city advisory boards. Others would simply go forth to give their time at local animal shelters. My efforts lead people to take pride in their community and engage in a process they wouldn’t have normally.</p></span></div>
