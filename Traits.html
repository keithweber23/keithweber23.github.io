Hired on as a driver for Enterprise Rental Car, I was one of nearly a handful employed to drive customers to and from the shop. One afternoon, a call to pick up a man who had just gotten into an accident, his wife and family friend were in the hospital. Arriving at the repair shop, the car looked near totaled, and its owner was caught up with the repair man. The customer, whom I’ll refer to as Brian hereon, was obviously in another time and place mentally. I left him be for now, instead choosing to start the process of shifting things over between vehicles; there was a good amount of luggage in that mangled wreck, they’d obviously been traveling. With time, he joins my side and we start making light of the situation. Hoping to keep his mind off the present, I shift our conversation to what their weekend plans had been; they were going on a cross state antiquing trip, they’re about half a state away from home.</p> <p class="indent">It’s hard to explain, but Brian and I just connected. Everytime he got too caught up in worry for his loved ones, we would drift to stories of happier times. We talked about his family, his work as an elementary school principal, and his time spent in the Navy traveling the world. Arriving at the hospital, I dropped him at the front doors, helped him sign in, and patiently waiting in the lobby. He came back in lighter spirits, as there was no fatal injuries and everyone would be released soon enough. Brian wasn’t terribly familiar with the area, so I helped book him a room at a local hotel while we waited for his wife and friend. When they arrived, Brian introduced me like family, and I couldn’t help but smile. First stopping by a pharmacy to fill scripts, we then headed to their hotel for the afternoon. Unloading their bags, I recommended food that delivered and got ready to say goodbyes. To my surprise, this didn’t involve any handshakes like I’m used to; after receiving the biggest hug, I was left with his (real) name and number with the instructions to call him if I ever needed a reference. That card still sits on my wall to this day.</p></span></div>
