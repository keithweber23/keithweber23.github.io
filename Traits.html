                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Record Shopping</b> <p class="indent flow-text">My example narrative of high integrity began in Kansas City about three years back, in 2014. By this point in my life, I had been collecting vinyl records for a couple years and was eager to find a good quality discography for some of the classic artists of the 60’s. While browsing the collection at this store called “It’s a Beautiful Day” I came across pristine ‘best of’ albums for both the Beatles and Bob Dylan; the sticker price for both was about half of what they’re normally worth. I was ecstatic with my findings. However, upon checking out, I learn they only would take cash or checks at this particular store, not cards. Bummed out and without the cash to cover both, I began the deliberation process for which album I would leave behind.</p><p class="indent flow-text">The owner of the store would speak up before I could make my decision, “Take both and give me what you’ve got. You can pay me back when you stop by next,” I insisted I couldn’t take her up on the offer “I’m almost never in Kansas City and it might be a while until I pay you back,” Yet she persisted saying she didn’t mind. Fast forward three years. I had finally made a trip to KC where I had time to go to see the store. With a brief explanation, I repaid my debt with interest and thanked them for being so understanding years back. It took a few years but I was true to my word, something that I try to exemplify in many aspects of my life.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Traveling Through Europe</b> <p class="indent flow-text">Two days before the Christmas of 2015 marked the first time I left my hometown for longer than a week; this marked the beginning of a journey I wouldn’t return from for nearly 8 months. This journey of mine began in London, England and I would stay just long enough to experience New Years. Subsequently, I would spend over a month backpacking through the rest of continental Europe couch-surfing while booking last-minute spots in hostels dorms. I often found myself changing homes every two or three nights; occasionally, I made plans to cross the countries I found myself in with strangers. Often I would know these new friends just a day or two, and in one case hours before leaving.</p><p class="indent flow-text">With classes less than a week away, I took a plane to Holland. The plane arrived in the dark of night, and I had no home to stay at until my rental agreement began nearly a week later; luckily, that same day, I found refuge on the couch of a Dutch elementary school teacher named Hans. I stayed with him for 5 days, sharing a small room with 6 other backpackers. In exchange for board and loaning a bike, I would cook for him. This experience became one of the most exhilarating and liberating experiences of my trip.</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Human Rights Educator</b> <p class="indent flow-text">Spring of 2017 I began working with Boys and Girls Club of Manhattan. The Club tasked me with educating Jr. High and Highschool students on human rights, leadership, and current events. However, this task took much more consideration than we originally planned. The material they provided was inadequate for engaging the students and lacked relatability. So with weeks of restructuring, I began to shape the subjects around items they could relate to, like video games and projects that engaged community areas they cared about. Eventually, the lessons started taking hold and we were able to expand on what it means to lead, as well as social and racial injustices within the USA and abroad; these topics represented a cross-section of conversations that the children rarely had time to discuss within their classes.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Driver for Enterprise</b> <p class="indent flow-text">It was the start of fall in 2016, I had been settling into my first of two jobs I would be working that summer. Hired on as a driver for Enterprise Rental Car, I was one of nearly a handful employed to drive customers to and from the shop. One afternoon, a call to pick up a man who had just gotten into an accident, his wife and family friend were in the hospital. Arriving at the repair shop, the car looked near totaled, and its owner was caught up with the repair man. The customer, whom I’ll refer to as Brian hereon, was obviously in another time and place mentally. I left him be for now, instead choosing to start the process of shifting things over between vehicles; there was a good amount of luggage in that mangled wreck, they’d obviously been traveling. With time, he joins my side and we start making light of the situation. Hoping to keep his mind off the present, I shift our conversation to what their weekend plans had been; they were going on a cross state antiquing trip, they’re about half a state away from home.</p> <p class="indent flow-text">It’s hard to explain, but Brian and I just connected. Everytime he got too caught up in worry for his loved ones, we would drift to stories of happier times. We talked about his family, his work as an elementary school principal, and his time spent in the Navy traveling the world. Arriving at the hospital, I dropped him at the front doors, helped him sign in, and patiently waiting in the lobby. He came back in lighter spirits, as there was no fatal injuries and everyone would be released soon enough. Brian wasn’t terribly familiar with the area, so I helped book him a room at a local hotel while we waited for his wife and friend. When they arrived, Brian introduced me like family, and I couldn’t help but smile. First stopping by a pharmacy to fill scripts, we then headed to their hotel for the afternoon. Unloading their bags, I recommended food that delivered and got ready to say goodbyes. To my surprise, this didn’t involve any handshakes like I’m used to; after receiving the biggest hug, I was left with his (real) name and number with the instructions to call him if I ever needed a reference. That card still sits on my wall to this day.</p></span></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Addiction Research</b> <p class="indent flow-text">Coming to college I wanted to make an impact in the realm of addiction and drug use. Early on it became a personal mission of mine to bring change to the topic. Freshman year, I would join a Psychology lab doing research on impulsive choice (a key aspect of addiction). Within classes, I’ve made strides to somehow incorporate addiction research within my papers, projects, and presentations. While abroad in North Holland, I visited with local mental health clinics & addiction centers. During these visits, I gained valuable knowledge of international approaches to the subject. I had focused my learnings on both grassroots efforts and public policy while abroad. Most important of my learnings was how they used community outreach and safety nets to prevent reincarcerations.</p><p class="indent flow-text">Returning home, I hoped to take up arms for the effort. I joined a city advisory committee that focused on dispersing funds for alcohol and substance abuse within Manhattan, KS. On this board, I’ve reviewed numerous grant requests and performed site visits to multiple addiction focused organizations. We distribute these grants yearly and the site visits allowed us to gauge their community impacts. Being a member of the board allows me to use my knowledge to encourage financial support for programs that are likely to succeed in their efforts.</p></span></div>
