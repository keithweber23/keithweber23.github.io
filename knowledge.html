Scholarly achievement, extracurricular activities, and social engagement would all fall into the future category. The present is best summarized by the paying for classes each semester. In part thanks to high school AP transfer credits, my scholarships were pretty much dead in the water by my second semester at University. My allotments from FAFSA alone didn’t cover the costs of school, so I’ve carefully balanced ten part-time jobs over the last four years. Working two jobs at once wasn’t entirely uncommon for me. To maximize my income, I’d switch positions over the summer to get more hours and a higher pay rate. To cut costs, I lived at home with my parents. I maintained my membership in Kappa Sigma by offsetting my dues with alumni scholarships.</p><p class="indent flow-text">With only capstone’s and higher level courses left, I hoped to position myself to focus exclusively on school my senior year. Such classes required strict attention and holding a job wouldn’t allow that. With this in mind, I began teaching myself the stock market. I wanted to leverage my capital. I knew investing had its risks but I was confident in my abilities. I made a point to wake up before the bell rang every day. I tracked trends and learned from my mistakes. Within three months time, my dedication paid off. I had passed the year to date (YTD) growth of most indexes in a quarter of the time. This success was more than a lucky gamble, it represented a personal achievement. I’m proud of the fact I thrived in this foreign and unforgiving environment.</p></span></div>

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span><b>Teaching Inequality Without Bias</b><p class="indent flow-text">Teaching isn’t always easy, especially when students feel no connection to the topics covered. While working with boys and girls club, my task was getting students to engage with an idea never before implemented at our site, human rights. For this task, I hoped to explore much further than the basic human rights that stem from the UN. My class included an ethnically and financially diverse group of jr. High students. Some students already had an understanding of various inequalities. Beginning with our 30 basic human rights declared by the UN, I would bring in games played in poor countries abroad to help bring some fun into the lessons. Next, I engaged the ideas of food insecurity and socio-economic inequality using the games like the plastic bag and twine soccer balls as a reference.</p><p class="indent flow-text">We would go on to play a computer game, called SPENT, to help students understand some of the remarkably tough decisions that disadvantaged Americans encounter every day. Our group had the hardest time getting our family to survive a month in the conditions presented. We then dove into the ideas of taxing and what exactly that provided them. We conducted all programs with a conscious effort to avoid any political agenda pushing on our behalf; rather, we hoped to get students asking questions that helped them find their beliefs on their own accord. This strategy wasn’t meant to keep politics out of the picture, on the contrary, it often brought it to the forefront of our discussions. These discussions, without a biased agenda, allowed us to help our students grow and understand the world as well as the ideologies within it.</p></span></div>
